# Task2
Internship Project - Plant Leaf Disease Detection System Using AI Algorithms

The project involves collecting a dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images, training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the images, and developing a user-friendly web interface where farmers can upload leaf images and receive instant disease diagnosis and management recommendations.
